# Maze-solver

mazeSolver.py contains code to find and plot a solution through a maze, generated by the gen_maze2() function in MazeGen.py. mazeSolver.py was written by me, mazeSolver.py was written by Jed Rembold, a professor of Data Science at Willamette University. During my undergrad years, Jed put forth a maze challenge for his physics students that involved plotting a path through a randomly generated maze.

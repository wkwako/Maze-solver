# Maze-solver

mazeSolver.py contains code to find and plot a solution through a maze, generated by the gen_maze2() function in MazeGen.py. mazeSolver.py was written by me, mazeSolver.py was written by Jed Rembold, a professor of Data Science at Willamette University. During my undergrad years, Jed put forth a maze challenge for his physics students that involved plotting a path through a randomly generated maze. More information can be found on his site here: https://jrembold.github.io/code_challenge/challenges.html#

To run: download both mazeSolver.py and MazeGen.py. Put them in the same folder, and run mazeSolver.py.
